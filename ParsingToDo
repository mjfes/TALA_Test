3 File Formats to consider

Graph DB supported formats: 
Turtle, a compact, human-friendly format.
N-Triples, a very simple, easy-to-parse, line-based format that is not as compact as Turtle.
N-Quads, a superset of N-Triples, for serializing multiple RDF graphs.
JSON-LD, a JSON-based serialization.
N3 or Notation3, a non-standard serialization that is very similar to Turtle, but has some additional features, such as the ability to define inference rules.
RDF/XML, an XML-based syntax that was the first standard format for serializing RDF.
RDF/JSON, an alternative syntax for expressing RDF triples using a simple JSON notation.

FID Formats: 

XML/RDF 
MODS 
MARC


Current Issues: 

for XML/RDF: Validation fails?
for MODS : find conversion method (see:issues)
for MARC : find conversion method
